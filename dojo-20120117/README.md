# Dojo 3 - Plataformatec - January 17th 2012 #

## Problem ##

For this third Dojo, we decided to solve [The String Set problem](https://sites.google.com/site/tddproblems/all-problems-1/String-set) problem.

## Languages and tools ##

We used [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) as the programming language and [E-unit](http://www.erlang.org/doc/apps/eunit/chapter.html) to test our code.

## Participants ##

* [Carlos Antônio](http://github.com/carlosantoniodasilva)
* [Fabio Yamate](http://github.com/fabioyamate)
* [George Guimarães](http://github.com/georgeguimaraes)
* [José Valim](http://github.com/josevalim)
* [Rafael França](http://github.com/rafaelfranca)
* [Rodrigo Flores](http://github.com/rodrigoflores)

## Result ##

We implemented the main features of the problem, but couldn't finish it. As it was the first
time the participants were coding in Erlang, we had a lot of trouble dealing with the language
(José, as an Erlang Guru, gave us a big help with the language) and to implement the String-set 
state-lessish way. But in the end we were quite happy that we were able to implement the recursions.

## To run the tests

Just run this command:

    ./rebar compile eunit
