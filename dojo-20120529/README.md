## Retrospective

### Things that worked

* Problem;
* Ruby's syntax for String;
* Ruby's functional aspects (map, times);
* New attendants;
* We kept the Dojo's collaborative spirit.

### Things that need some improvement

* Apple's keyboard;
* We couldn't pilot more than once;
* Tests written in english hindered the Dojo;
* People coding in their own notebooks instead of attending the Dojo;
* The environment wasn't well prepared;
* Too much people talking;
* Pilot and co-pilot should speak louder;
* We should have eaten before the Dojo;
