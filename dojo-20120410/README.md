## Retrospective

### Positives

* New language
* Easy problem made us focus on the language
* Learning a new programming language and its features
* Frequent refactorings
* We used Git to do version control of the development
* New participants (@carlosgaldino, @erichkist and @lucasmazza)
* We developed it in a top-down approach. Starting with the acceptance tests.

### Negatives

* We talked less than the last sessions, but we should not talk
* We should prepare an easy way to count time
* @cantoniodasilva didn't participate (we should think about a way for remote participation)
* We didn't have dinner :(
